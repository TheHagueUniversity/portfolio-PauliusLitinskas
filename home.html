      <p> My name is Paulius, and I am from a small country in the Baltics called Lithuania. I was born in the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. One of my biggest hobbies is motorcycles. I love everything about them, fixing them, whenever they are not working, modifying them, to make them look more unique, but the most I love riding them and doing crazy things, which sometimes is not very legal to do. Other than motorcycles, I also enjoy creating music, or just mixing random talks into music, and making some sort of a track from that. More about my personality traits: I am a hardworking person, when it comes to earning money, because I was raised to respect the value of money, and I understand that it is not easy to earn them, and you really need to keep track where you spend it. Also, I tend to sacrifice my own health sometimes, in order to help out my co-workers or friends, because for me, friends and family is a number one priority, and for people I trust, I am willing to give everything I can, to make their life easier or not so stressful. Although, sometimes I think about others too much, and forget that I should also take care of myself, and my own health. Also, I could say I am a generous person, I am always going to share my last 30 euros with a friend, so he could also buy some groceries, or maybe smokes, to survive until his payment.  </p>
