The job was pretty intense, and not so good paying, compared to the amount of work we had to do, but I really enjoyed earning my own money, and building financial independence from my parents, even though I was still going to school.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>Vilnius Gediminas engineering high school</h3> 
        <p>From 2011 until 2015</p>
        <p>It was not much different from a normal high school, but at that school, they expected everyone to be competent students on physics and math class, that's why I decided to go to a different school to get my diploma</p>

      <section>
      <h3>Vilnius private high school</h3>   
        <p>From 2015 until 2017</p>
        <p>I graduated from this school, since the teachers could pay more attention to the students, than in a public school, and that really helped me graduate high school with grades, that I did not expect to have.</p>
